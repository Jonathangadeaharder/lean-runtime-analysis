# Proposition 4: Witness non-aggregation (The Veto Effect)

This module mechanically verifies the deterministic landscape mechanics
of the non-separable trap game defined in Section 5 of the paper.
Because the arithmetic is strictly integer-based over boolean hypercubes,
we can perfectly resolve the exact geometric gaps using Lean 4's native `omega`.

The cross-interaction sum evaluated against a specific unit vector `y = e_k`.
When `y = e_k`, the inner summation collapses purely to the k-th term:
  3 * x_k + 3 * \sum_{i \neq k} (1 - x_i)
Using the identity `\sum_{i \neq k} (1 - x_i) = (n - 1) - (ones_x - x_k)`
we secure a closed-form integer polynomial.

Proposition 4, Part 1: Flipping bit `j` evaluated against the matched witness `y = e_j`.
The number of ones increases by 1, and the coordinate `x_j` flips from 0 to 1.
We prove this yields an exact fitness gain of +2.

Proposition 4, Part 2: Flipping bit `j` evaluated against a mismatched witness `y = e_i` (i ≠ j).
The number of ones increases by 1, but the coordinate `x_i` remains exactly 0.
We prove this yields an exact fitness penalty of -4.

Proposition 4, Part 3: The Archive Minimum Veto.
If the archive contains exactly the two target vulnerabilities `A^Y = {e_j, e_i}`,
the parent is evaluated as the minimum of the two witness scores.
When flipping bit `j`, the score against `e_j` improves by +2, but the score 
against `e_i` degrades by -4. The minimum strictly drops by at least 4.
This formally verifies that matched witnesses fail to aggregate under minimization.

The range of the interaction term against e_k is 3n + 3.
Under any decomposition f(x) + h(y) + R(x,y) with f = T_n,
the residual R(x, e_k) varies by at least 3n + 3 across candidates,
so ε ≥ (3n + 3) / 2.

This mechanizes the non-separability lower bound: the witness game
has ε = Θ(n), far beyond the phase boundary at ε = 1/n.
