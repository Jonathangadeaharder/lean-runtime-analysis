# Deep Think: Prove Two Remaining RLocalGames Axioms

## Context

Working in Lean 4 (Mathlib, v4.29.0). File: `RLocalGames.lean` in namespace `RLocalGames`. Two theorems remain as axioms and need to be proved (or the signatures need fixing).

The build is at `~/projects/drift_lean_build/`. Build with: `cd ~/projects/drift_lean_build && lake build RLocalGames`.

## The Structure

```lean
structure RLocalGame (α β : Type _) where
  f : α → ℝ
  h : β → ℝ
  n : ℕ
  r : ℕ
  S : Fin n → Finset (Fin n)
  R_k : Fin n → α → β → ℝ
  epsilon : ℝ
  h_r_pos : r ≥ 1
  h_S_size : ∀ k, (S k).card ≤ r
  h_S_sparsity : ∀ j, (Finset.filter (fun k => j ∈ S k) Finset.univ).card ≤ r
  h_R_bound : ∀ k x y, |R_k k x y| ≤ epsilon / n
```

## Problem 1: r_local_tightness (Proposition 1)

**Current axiom:**
```lean
axiom r_local_tightness (n r : ℕ) (epsilon : ℝ)
    (h_eps : epsilon ≥ 1 / r) :
    ∃ G : RLocalGame (Fin n → Bool) (Fin n → Bool),
      G.epsilon = epsilon ∧ G.r = r
```

**What to prove:** Given `n, r : ℕ` and `epsilon : ℝ` with `epsilon ≥ 1 / r`, construct an `RLocalGame (Fin n → Bool) (Fin n → Bool)` with the given `epsilon` and `r`.

**Construction hint:** Use a "zero game":
- `f := fun _ => 0`
- `h := fun _ => 0`
- `R_k := fun _ _ _ => 0` (so `epsilon / n` bound is satisfied since `|0| = 0 ≤ epsilon / n` when `epsilon ≥ 0`)
- `S k` can be any subset of size at most `r` — e.g., `Finset.empty` (size 0 ≤ r) for all k

**Key constraint to check:** `h_R_bound : ∀ k x y, |R_k k x y| ≤ epsilon / n` needs `0 ≤ epsilon / n`. Since `epsilon ≥ 1/r ≥ 0` (when r ≥ 1), and n > 0 (needed for Fin n), this holds.

**Difficulty:** Medium. The construction is straightforward but requires filling in all structure fields correctly in Lean 4, plus proving `epsilon / n ≥ 0` and handling the `n = 0` edge case.

## Problem 2: r_local_runtime_bound (Theorem 8)

**Current axiom:**
```lean
axiom r_local_runtime_bound (n r : ℕ) (epsilon lambda : ℝ)
    (h_eps : epsilon < 1 / r) :
    ∃ c > 0, ∀ x, x = c * n^2 * Real.log lambda
```

**THIS SIGNATURE IS BROKEN.** The `∀ x, x = c * n^2 * Real.log lambda` says "every real number equals `c * n^2 * log λ`", which is only true if ℝ has exactly one inhabitant — a contradiction. This cannot be proved as stated.

**Two options:**

### Option A: Fix the signature to match the paper's intent

The paper claims "the expected runtime is O(n² log λ)" where the drift is `δ = 2(1 - εr)/n` (from `r_local_alignment`). The additive drift theorem gives expected time `n/δ * log(λ) = n²/(2(1-εr)) * log(λ)`. The theorem should say:

```lean
theorem r_local_runtime_bound (n r : ℕ) (epsilon lambda : ℝ)
    (h_n : n ≥ 1) (h_r : r ≥ 1)
    (h_eps : epsilon < 1 / (r : ℝ)) (h_lambda : lambda > 1) :
    ∃ c > 0,
      c = n / (2 * (1 - epsilon * r)) ∧
      -- or just state the runtime bound differently
      (n : ℝ) ^ 2 / (2 * (1 - epsilon * r)) * Real.log lambda > 0 := by
```

But this is trivially true since `1 - εr > 0`, `n² > 0`, `log λ > 0`. The theorem isn't about Lean-level computation — it's a paper-level statement about expected runtime of an algorithm on these games.

**Recommendation:** Keep this as an `axiom` since it's a paper obligation about algorithm behavior (expected runtime of a specific optimization process on r-local games). The Lean formalization just needs to record that such a bound exists, and the paper proves it using the additive drift theorem.

### Option B: Make it a vacuous but provable statement

If you must eliminate the axiom, reframe it as:

```lean
theorem r_local_runtime_bound (n r : ℕ) (epsilon lambda : ℝ)
    (h_eps : epsilon < 1 / (r : ℝ))
    (h_r : r ≥ 1) (h_n : n ≥ 1) (h_lambda : lambda > 1) :
    ∃ c : ℝ, c > 0 ∧ c * n^2 * Real.log lambda > 0 := by
  use 1 / (2 * (1 - epsilon * r))
  constructor
  · -- positivity of c
    ...
  · -- positivity of c * n^2 * log lambda
    ...
```

This is provable but vacuous — it just says "there exists a positive constant such that c * n² * log λ > 0", which is true for any positive c when n ≥ 1 and λ > 1.

## What to actually do

1. **Prove `r_local_tightness`** with the zero-game construction. This is the valuable proof.
2. **Keep `r_local_runtime_bound` as an axiom** (it's a paper obligation about algorithm behavior, not something provable in this formalization framework) — OR reframe it to a trivially provable statement about positivity.

- `lt_div_iff₀`, `le_div_iff₀`, `div_lt_iff₀`, `div_le_iff₀` for field inequalities
- `abs_le.mp` / `abs_le.mpr` to destruct `|x| ≤ a` as `-a ≤ x ∧ x ≤ a`
- `Finset.abs_sum_le_sum_abs` for triangle inequality on sums
- `Finset.sum_filter_add_sum_filter_not` for splitting sums (use via `conv_lhs`)
- `linarith` handles linear arithmetic, NOT `2 * (ε/n)` from `ε/n` — use `field_simp; ring` for that
- `Fin.size_positive (j : Fin n)` gives `0 < n`
- `nlinarith` for some nonlinear facts
- `omega` for natural number arithmetic
